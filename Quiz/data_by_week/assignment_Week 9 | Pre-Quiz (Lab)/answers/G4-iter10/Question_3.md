Question:
<div><p><span>Please select the correct three sentences regarding D3 geo projections</span></p></div>

Choices:
1. [[81326]] - The aim of D3’s projection methods is to project a 3D space (spherical coordinates) on a cartesian plane (2D).
2. [[1260]] - D3 has several built-in projections. Some of them are useful to display the boundaries of the USA and others are better suited for visualizing the world atlas(e.g. as a globe)
3. [[38286]] - D3 projections are not configurable. We can only change the projection type but no other options.
4. [[80766]] - The path generator takes the projected 2D geometry and formats it appropriately for SVG

Correct Answers:
1. [[81326]] - The aim of D3’s projection methods is to project a 3D space (spherical coordinates) on a cartesian plane (2D).
