Question:
<div><p><strong><i>Method chaining</i></strong><span> is a common technique in JavaScript, especially when working with D3. Please select the correct sentences:</span></p></div>

Choices:
1. [[86500]] - Method chaining can be used to simplify code in scenarios that involve calling multiple functions consecutively. Each method returns an object, allowing the calls to be chained together in a single statement without requiring variables to store the intermediate results.
2. [[77367]] - By “chaining” methods together with an ampersand (“&”) you can perform several actions in a single line of code
3. [[34425]] - When chaining methods together, the order matters! The output type of one method has to match the input type expected by the next method in the chain.

Correct Answers:
1. [[86500]] - Method chaining can be used to simplify code in scenarios that involve calling multiple functions consecutively. Each method returns an object, allowing the calls to be chained together in a single statement without requiring variables to store the intermediate results.
3. [[34425]] - When chaining methods together, the order matters! The output type of one method has to match the input type expected by the next method in the chain.
