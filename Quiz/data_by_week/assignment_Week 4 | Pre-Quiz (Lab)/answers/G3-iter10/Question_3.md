Question:
<div><span>The arrangement of shapes is crucial when working on visualizations. Most of the time we don’t want that some visual elements obscure others. How can we influence the depth order when working with SVG elements?</span></div>

Choices:
1. [[15589]] - Similar to CSS we can use the “z-index” property to change the depth order. An element with greater depth order is always in front of an element with a lower depth order.
2. [[63288]] - The SVG property “depth” allows us to change the drawing order (Integer value between 0 and 100). An element with an higher number (depth order) is always in front of an element with a lower number.
3. [[64101]] - The order in which elements are coded determines their depth order. SVG has no real layering concept, meaning that you can only manipulate the drawing order. SVG elements that should be in the front, should be added at the end.

Correct Answers:
3. [[64101]] - The order in which elements are coded determines their depth order. SVG has no real layering concept, meaning that you can only manipulate the drawing order. SVG elements that should be in the front, should be added at the end.
