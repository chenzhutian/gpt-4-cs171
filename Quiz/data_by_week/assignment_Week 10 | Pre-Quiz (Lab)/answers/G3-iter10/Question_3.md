Question:
<div><p>Please select the correct sentences regarding SVG paths and the implementation with D3: (select all that apply)</p></div>

Choices:
1. [[75890]] - You can use an SVG path to make any type of SVG shape
2. [[68116]] - D3's path generators (e.g. d3.svg.arc()) can take our data and convert it into the SVG path commands (x/y coordinates)
3. [[27062]] - When we want to use a D3 path generator, we have to initialize it first and provide accessor function for the x and y coordinates from our data
4. [[57439]] - If you want to draw an SVG path, you have to use the helper classes of D3 for generating SVG path commands
5. [[86283]] - You can either specify the SVG path commands manually in the "d" attribute or you can use D3's helper classes to generate these commands dynamically (e.g. for areas, lines, arcs)

Correct Answers:
