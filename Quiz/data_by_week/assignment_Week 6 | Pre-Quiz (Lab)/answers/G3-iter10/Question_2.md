Question:
<div>
<span>The update pattern is D3’s core technique: a data-join is followed by operations on the </span><strong>enter</strong><span>, </span><strong>update</strong><span> and </span><strong>exit</strong><span> selections. Suppose we have created a bar chart and want to render the chart with new data again. Please select the correct answers regarding the three virtual selections (enter, update, exit):</span>
</div>

Choices:
1. [[47713]] - The “enter” selection contains placeholders for elements which do not exist yet (i.e. there are more data points than elements)
2. [[72693]] - The “update” selection contains all the existing elements that are also associated to the new data. This section help us to update the chart so that it matches the new data (e.g., update bar height)
3. [[12163]] - The “exit” selection contains the old dataset. It helps us to delete everything and to draw a completely new chart with the new data.
4. [[73781]] - The “exit” selection contains all the existing elements that are not associated with data anymore (i.e. there are fewer data points than elements)

Correct Answers:
1. [[47713]] - The “enter” selection contains placeholders for elements which do not exist yet (i.e. there are more data points than elements)
2. [[72693]] - The “update” selection contains all the existing elements that are also associated to the new data. This section help us to update the chart so that it matches the new data (e.g., update bar height)
4. [[73781]] - The “exit” selection contains all the existing elements that are not associated with data anymore (i.e. there are fewer data points than elements)
