# Beyond generating code: Evaluating GPT on a Data Visualization Course

This repository contains the supplementary materials for the paper "_Beyond Generating Code: Evaluating GPT on a Data
Visualization Course_".

![Teaser Figure: Our experiments show that GPT can a) clean and explore CSV datasets, b) read visualizations in SVG format, interact with visualizations through dispatching Javascript events, and c) create explanatory visualizations to present data insights.](src/teasear.png)
